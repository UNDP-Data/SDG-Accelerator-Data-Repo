    "SDGMomentGDP": "South Africa is one of 65 economies out of 186 globally that are in mitigation mode in 2023 and projected to remain within it in 2024 and 2025. In a context of high unemployment, elevated poverty rates, and high incomeinequality, the policy space for achieving the SDGs is limited. This puts pressure on mitigating the impact of economic downturns on the most vulnerable households, informal workers, youth, and MSMEs.",
    "SDGMomentPeoplePlanet": "South Africa's slow economic growth cycle will continue to be dependent on carbon emissions, as the country's carbon emissions intensity of GDP only changes by an annual rate of 2% under the current conditions. This pace of economic growth, on the other hand, is not expected to exert a noticeable effect on lowering the incidence of poverty, leaving it virtually unchanged in the short-term. Hence, significant distributional challenges remain to overcome this stagnation of progress.",
    "SDGMomentConclusion": "Moving forward, the urgency to address climate change, reduce inequalities, poverty and unemployment has never been greater. Guided by SDGs and the national priorities, South Africa should continue to innovate, adapt, and scale up efforts to accelerate progress towards a more equitable, inclusive, and sustainable future.",
    "SDGMomentSubtext": "The economic cycle is determined by adjusting countryâ€™s current GDP growth forecasts (April 2023) by their gap relative to the forecasts made before the pandemic and subsequent crises (October 2019). If the adjusted rates (not shown) are below 2% it is considered that the economy is in mitigation; it is muddling through if the adjusted rates range 2%-4%, and it's in acceleration if they are above 4%.\nCO2 emissions intensity of GDP is computed as tonnesof CO2 per $1,000 (2017 PPP).",

The persistent issue of electricity load shedding highlights the need for short-term and medium-term strategies. However, a long-term focus on significantly increasing the share of renewable energy is essential. This would result in greater electricity availability, reduced business disruptions, environmental protection, and decreased inequality.\nSouth Africa has established a comprehensive Just Energy Transition strategy aimed at transitioning to a low-carbon economy while fostering economic growth and social justice. The strategy encompasses various elements such as renewable energy, energy efficiency, a just transition, green jobs, energy access, and energy security.\nWhen undertaking these investments, it is vital to incorporate safeguards to ensure that the bottom 40% of the population is not left behind. This emphasizes the importance of inclusive approaches that consider the needs and welfare of all segments of society.",
